# GROCERIES EXPLORATORY-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT-USING-SQL

# Context

I got this groceries_dataset from Kaggle where I wanted to understand the customers purchasing habit; the items mostly purchased including the days and time of month the items are purchased.

This is quite important because it helps the stakeholders to understand what influences consumers' buying decisions. By understanding how consumers decide on a product, they can fill in the gap in the market and identify the products that are needed and the products that are obsolete.

# Tools Used
Microsoft Excel

MYSQL

# Datasets
The datasets was gotten from kaggle and it comprises of 3 columns with the description(Member_number, Date, itemDescription) with 38777 rows.

# Solution

Upon download of the dataset from kaggle, I noticed the Date wasn't in MYSQL date format. MySQL retrieves and displays DATE values in  ' YYYY-MM-DD ' format but the groceries_dataset was in the excel date format so I changed the format by using the Format cells option.

Then I imported the changed dataset in csv(comma seperated values) into MYSQL workbench using the import wizard and created a database schema 'groceries_project' that will house the table.

    CREATE DATABASE groceries_project
    USE groceries_project;
